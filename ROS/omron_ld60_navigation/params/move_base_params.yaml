# A list of recovery behavior plugins to use with move_base, 
# see pluginlib documentation for more details on plugins. 
# These behaviors will be run when move_base fails to find a valid plan in the order that they are specified. 
# After each behavior completes, move_base will attempt to make a plan. 
# If planning is successful, move_base will continue normal operation. 
# Otherwise, the next recovery behavior in the list will be executed.
